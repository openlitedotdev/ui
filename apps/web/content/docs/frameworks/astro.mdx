Requirements:

- [React 18](https://reactjs.org/) or later
- [Tailwind CSS 3.4](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/astro) or later

<Callout>
Open UI is built on top of React, so you need to install React first. You can follow the official
[integration guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/react/) to install React.

## Installation

In your Astro project, run one of the following command to install Open UI:

### npm

```sh
npm install @openlabs/theme @openui-org/react
```

### pnpm

```sh
pnpm add @openlabs/theme @openui-org/react
```

### Tailwind CSS Setup

Open UI is built on top of Tailwind CSS, so you need to install Tailwind CSS first. You can follow the official [installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/astro) to install Tailwind CSS. Then you need to add

the following code to your `tailwind.config.mjs` file:

```js
// tailwind.config.mjs
import { openui } from "@openlabs/theme"

export default {
  content: [
    //...
    "./node_modules/@openlabs/theme/dist/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [openui()]
}
```

### Ready 🎉

Now you can import Open UI components and use them in your Astro project:

```markdown
---
import Layout from '../layouts/Layout.astro';
import { Button } from '@openui-org/react';
---

<Layout title="Welcome to Astro.">
  <main>
      <Button client:visible>My button</Button>
  </main>
</Layout>
```
