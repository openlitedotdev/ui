Requirements:

- [React 18](https://reactjs.org/) or later
- [Tailwind CSS 3.4](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite#react) or later

## Installation

### npm

```sh
npm install @openlabs/theme @openlabs/ui
```

### pnpm

```sh
pnpm add @openlabs/theme @openlabs/ui
```

## Tailwind CSS Setup

Open UI is built on top of Tailwind CSS, so you need to install Tailwind CSS first. You can follow the official installation guide to install Tailwind CSS. Then you need to add the following code to your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
import { openui } from "@openlabs/theme"

/** @type {import("tailwindcss").Config} */
export default {
  content: [
    //...
    "./node_modules/@openlabs/theme/dist/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [openui()]
}
```

## Example

Now, you can use the component you installed in your application 🎉.

```jsx
import { Button } from "@openlabs/ui"

export default function App() {
  return <Button>Press me</Button>
}
```
